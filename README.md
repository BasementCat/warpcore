# WarpCore VC Framework

WarpCore is a tiny View/Controller framework for PHP (models are not implemented - try something like RedBean).  The goal is to provide a very flexible framework that eliminates the hassles of dealing with routing and views, and enabling a developer to easily map clean URLs to function calls.
